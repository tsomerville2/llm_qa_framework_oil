I used a spring-mix base, chopped cucumbers, cherry tomatoes, grilled chicken breast, feta crumbles, and about two tablespoons of store-bought ranch salad dressing\u2014Ken\u2019s Steakhouse brand.

Quick recap of the main seed-oil culprits: 1) the ranch salad dressing (usually contains soybean or canola oil), 2) the Wheat Thins crackers (typically use canola and/or soybean oil), and 3) the fried chicken cooked in vegetable oil. If you\u2019d like, we can discuss alternatives or strategies to cut down on those oils."
