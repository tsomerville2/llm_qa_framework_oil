        "content": "Perfect, thanks for sharing your full day. To recap the main seed-oil sources: the fries at lunch (peanut oil) and the mayonnaise in your tuna salad both introduced seed or legume oils. If you\u2019re aiming to cut back, you could swap the mayo for an avocado-based spread or olive-oil mayo, and bake potato wedges at home in olive oil instead of grabbing restaurant fries. Otherwise, your breakfast and snacks were pretty seed-oil-light. Let me know if you\u2019d like more tips!"
