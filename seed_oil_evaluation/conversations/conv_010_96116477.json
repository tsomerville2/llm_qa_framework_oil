Quick seed-oil highlights:\n\u2022 Almonds: Many roasted varieties (including some Blue Diamond flavors) are finished in canola or sunflower oil.\n\u2022 KIND protein bar: The label lists sunflower oil as a binder.\n\u2022 Classico Tomato & Basil pasta sauce: uses soybean and/or canola oil for texture.\nIf you\u2019d like to cut back, look for dry-roasted almonds without added oil, protein bars sweetened with dates or whey crisps but no seed oils, and pasta sauces that rely solely on olive oil\u2014or make your own. Let me know if you want more tips!"
